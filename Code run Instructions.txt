1. ipynb files for each model is avaliable in their respective folder
2. Inorder to run BERT and RoBERTa models in google colab, upload the datasets in colab or Jupyter and simply click run all.
3. Set data_exists = False in the initial code cell. These two models take 40mns on GPU. You can check the predcitions by 
using the saved model model.h5

4. For PubMED and Bio_Clinical upload their respective folders in your google drive, change the paths in code to your drive location.
5. These models take 120mns with gpu to train. Make sure to upload the 5 datasets(train, test, patient notes, sample_submissions, features)
into the colab before running.
6. Saved weights are avaliable in the folder which can be used to predict on the test data.
